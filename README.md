Hi, my name is Kyle Champley.  I've worked my entire career on tomographic imaging.  Currently I work at [Ziteo Medical](https://ziteo.com/) where I am leading a team in developing a novel high-resolution SPECT system.  Previously, I worked at [LLNL](https://www.llnl.gov/) in the [Nondestructive Characterization Institute](https://nci.llnl.gov/) working on x-ray and neutron CT.  I've also worked at GE Global Research where I worked in the CT group and consulted/ contracted for several medical imaging companies, including [PET/X](https://www.petxllc.com/), [Imatrex](https://www.linkedin.com/company/imatrex/), and Precision Sensing.

Here on github I contribute to the [LEAP-CT](https://github.com/LLNL/LEAP/), [XrayPhysics](https://github.com/kylechampley/XrayPhysics), and [LEAPCT-UI-GUI](https://github.com/kylechampley/LEAPCT-UI-GUI) software packages.

I'm happy to provide support for any of these open-source projects, but if you're in need of extra help with your tomography data, I can provide further assistance as a paid contractor.  Please contact me by email and we can work out the details.
